# Good Practices for Software Development

### Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?

Here are some points that were new to me:

- Observing how issues are reported and managed in large open-source projects.
- Using time-tracking applications like Boosted to enhance productivity.

### Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

Here are some areas where I need improvement and my ideas for making progress:

- Close non-essential background applications to improve performance.
- Regularly communicate with teammates to understand their work schedules and set up calls during their free time.
- Turn off notifications for non-work-related apps and keep the phone on silent to minimize distractions.
- Maintain a balanced diet to avoid overeating or undereating, which can affect concentration levels.
- Engage in physical activities like playing a sport or practicing yoga for at least 20-30 minutes to keep energy levels high throughout the day.
