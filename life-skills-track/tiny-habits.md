## Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

**Question 1**

In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

**Ans:** The most interesting idea is to make a tiny after you do something which is already a habit of yours. The tiny habit should be an easy task to do so that it does not need very high motivation. Eventually, with time, this tiny habit will grow and will lead to an outcome that you need from that habit.
For example, the idea of doing two push-ups after you use the restroom is a great way to bring push-ups into your daily habit.

**Question 2**

How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

**Ans:** M stands for motivation, A stands for ability, and P stands for prompt. We can apply this methodology to habit formation. Make the tiniest version of the habit so that the ability required to perform that task is low. Use action prompts so you already have the momentum for the tiny habit. With time, shine your tiny habit by pushing yourself and eventually, you will form the new habit
Use BJ Fogg's method of "After I do this, I will do this" for your action prompt.

**Question 3**

Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

**Ans:** People think that only great successes should be celebrated. However, it is important to celebrate each successful completion of the tiny habit because it increases your confidence and motivates you to push yourself to grow the habit and eventually make it a part of your daily habit routine.

**Question 4**

In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

**Ans:** The most interesting story for me was the professor of photography asking his one batch of students to click a hundred photos and the other batch to click only one photo which should be perfect. Here we are comparing quantity and quality, most of us would think quality is supreme over quantity. However, in this assignment given by the professor, it turned out that students who were given the task of clicking a hundred photos (quantity) were better than the students who tried to click only one perfect photo.
Ultimately, it means that repeating the tasks brings perfection to you. Therefore, if you want to get better at something, just keep repeating it.

**Question 5**

What is the book's perspective about Identity?

**Ans:** The perspective about identity is that the most effective way to change your habits is to focus on becoming the type of person you want to be, rather than focusing on what you want to achieve. For example, instead of saying "I want to run a marathon," you would say "I want to become a runner."
By following this method you new habits naturally with your identity and becomes easier to adopt it.

**Question 6**

Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

**Ans:**

- Environment is a necessary step for habit formation. Instead of the environment forcing you to make a habit. You can be the architect of your environment. For example, if you want to drink more water, place water bottles around your home and workspace.
- Start with the tiniest version of the habit so it is easier to do, even when you do not have any motivation for it
- Celebrate the success of completion of each tiny habit which will increase the confidence and grow your new habit.

**Question 7**

Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

**Ans:**

- Make the environment such it is difficult to do the task. For example, if you want to watch less TV, take the batteries out of the remote.
- Always consider the negative impacts of the bad habit.
- Make it unrewarding like charging yourself a fine of ten rupees every time engage in a bad habit.

## Reflection:

**Question 8**

Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

**Ans:** I will buy a book and put it on my bed. Every time, I lie down on my bed, I will read 2 sentences from the book. And after reading it, I will celebrate the completion of reading sentences from the book by drinking water.

**Question 9**

Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

**Ans:** I will put my phone in "do not disturb" mode once I go to bed so that a notification sound does not trigger me to use the phone before sleeping. If somehow I use the phone, I will log out of my social applications for a day.
